I'm a final year PhD student in machine learning and computational biology under the joint 
supervision of [Laura Cantini](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/laura-cantini/) at 
[Institut Pasteur](https://www.pasteur.fr) and [Gabriel PeyrÃ©](http://www.gpeyre.com/) 
at [ENS PSL](https://www.ens.psl.eu/). 

My research focuses on the development of novel machine learning methods for the analysis 
of high-dimensional genomics data, with a particular emphasis on using Optimal Transport 
to integrate multiple single-cell modalities. 

In a broader picture, I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, 
mathematics and life sciences. I believe that leveraging strong mathematical principles 
and incorporating prior expert knowledge is crucial for developing robust
methods to tackle complex problems.
